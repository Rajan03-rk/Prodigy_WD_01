## Interactive Navigation Menu

This project demonstrates a simple and interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation menu is fixed at the top of the page and changes its background color when the user scrolls down. The menu contains links to different sections of the page, which are styled with custom icons and hover effects.

## Features

- **Fixed Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page, ensuring that users can easily navigate between sections.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking on a menu item smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, ensuring it works well on various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: The navigation menu items change color when hovered over.
- **Section Highlighting**: The sections of the page are color-coded for easy visual distinction.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the page and the navigation menu.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the navigation menu and page sections.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the interaction when the user scrolls down the page.

## Usage

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file contains a `<nav>` element for the navigation bar and four `<section>` elements corresponding to "Home," "About," "Services," and "Contact" sections. Each section is styled with a different background color.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file is responsible for the visual appearance of the navigation bar and the page sections. It includes styles for the navbar, icons, hover effects, and responsive design.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**: The `script.js` file should contain JavaScript to add interactivity, such as changing the navbar's background color when scrolling down the page. *(Note: The JavaScript code isn't provided in the initial code snippet, so you'll need to implement it or include relevant code here.)*

## Customization

- **Icons**: You can replace the existing icons with your own by modifying the `<img>` elements in the HTML file. Ensure the image paths are correct.
- **Colors**: The background colors for the sections can be easily changed in the CSS file by modifying the `background-color` property for each section.
- **Padding and Margin**: Adjust the spacing of the navigation menu items and sections by modifying the `padding` and `margin` properties in the CSS file.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the navigation menu and page sections.
3. Scroll through the page to see the navbar's background color change and interact with the menu items.

## Note

- Ensure the paths to the icons in the `<img>` tags are correct. If you move the project files, you might need to update these paths.
- The provided JavaScript file (`script.js`) is not yet implemented, so the navbar interaction might not work until the JavaScript logic is added.
